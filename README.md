# Nutrition Choice
 World Food India Hackathon 2017 : Ministry of Food Processing Industries

### Problem Statements:
  (a) Nutritional status of food & dietary requirement <br />
  (b) Regional Culinary Information from various parts of the country <br />
  (c) Reducing food wastage

### Solution
Nowadays food consumers are very health conscious. Different gender and age groups have different nutritional requirement profile and it is not possible for each and every person to consult doctor or dietician to decide their food dietary requirement. So an Android application that can show dietary requirement of the user and also gives information about nutritional status of different food will help to this problem.
